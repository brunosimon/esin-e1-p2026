                    <p class="text">Diplomacy: From an early age, Mel can be seen to have a knack at politics. During her time living in Piltover, she rose to power of a councilor of clans, despite her position within her own clan.

                                    Painting: Mel is a talented painter, specifically with egg tempera paintings. Currently all the paintings in her home were done by her.</p>

                        As the daughter of Ambessa, a Runeterra Crest icon.png Noxian Warlord, Mel would learn about death and war from a young age. However, her advocacy of diplomacy and distaste for intimidating violence as a deterrent would later be deemed a liability by her mother. She was disowned and banished to Piltover Crest icon.png Piltover. Despite being a Medarda, one of the richest clans in the city, she would be considered as an outcast amongst her Piltovan family members.
                        
                        With dedication and political talents, Mel would succeed in rising up the political ranks of her clan, becoming a member of the Council of Clans.</p>

                    <p class="text">During the trial of one Jayce Talis Jayce Talis she would learn about the potential of magic being utilized with technology. This would intrigue her enough that she would vote for Jayce's expulsion from the Academy (as oppose to his banishment from Piltover), even convincing another councilor to vote in her favor.

                        Later on, she would even help Jayce and Viktor Viktor with their attempt to sneak into Heimerdinger's Heimerdinger's lab, stipulating to them that they have one night to prove themselves and that their invention is workable. She then aids in concealing their activities by distracting a guard patrolling the Academy. After Heimerdinger arrives to thwart the two in conducting their experiment, he arrives too late and the two manages to prove they can harness magic via Hextech. Although Heimerdinger doesn't think Piltover should enable Hextech, Mel intercedes and proclaims that is an issue for the council to decide.
                        
                        With her influence, the council votes towards the open implementation of Hextech, even funding the construction of the Hexgates.</p>

                    <p class="text">As a Councilor, Mel was present during the 200th Piltovan Progress Day, where Jayce was to reveal his new Hextech inventions. With Jayce faltering in the last minute, she would leave the celebration early. This however, did not stop her in eventually turning Jayce to her side, with political scheming and intimate relations. She managed to thwart Heimerdinger from his seat through manipulation while also getting Jayce appointed as a council member.

                        Due to the increased violence from Zaun Crest icon.png Zaun and the death of her brother Kino, her mother would arrive in Piltover to closer inspect the actions of her daughter. Objecting to the violent approach suggested by her mother, she would advise Jayce and the council to find more peaceful and diplomatic approaches to the Zaunite crisis before Noxus intervened. This would ultimately lead to Jayce brokering a peace with Silco Silco in exchange for Zaun's independence. Siding with Jayce, Mel would be the first councilor to agree to this proposal, spurring the rest to follow suit.
                        
                        While the meeting was almost done and the crisis nearly averted, Jinx Jinx attacked the council chambers; her Super Mega Death Rocket Super Mega Death Rocket hitting the glass window right next to Mel. It is unclear if Mel survived that attack.</p>

She would be concerned over his issues and would give him sound advice, all while still putting her own goals into consideration. Over time, Mel became less reserved around Jayce and began sharing personal details about herself as well. While Mel's relationship with Jayce started out as a means to an end, it ultimately became sincere love. Mel was crucial in Jayce's meteoric rise to fame; she even swayed the council to elevate Jayce and grant him a seat on the council.</p>
